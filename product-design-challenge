Product design challenge:
1. gather problem and challenges - timed 
2. Presentations - problem statements 
3. vote on the problems - dot voting
4. prioriting challenges - pick the one with most votes
5. reframe challenges - HMW (how might we) make sure …..
6. Solution building - post-its; everyone creates as many solutions as possible; pump out as many ideas as possible; eg, how did google or uber solved this?
7. vote on solutions - 6 dots - solutions they think they are important and want to work in short term
8. Prioritise solutions
9. Decide what to execute
10. Create an effort impact (effort on x-axis) graph - top left is the high impact low effort solution
11. Create actionable tasks and build the solution

creative problem solving - remove the open unstructured discussion; use of post-its to focus on the solutions without talking; very directed way to get things planned and coming up with actioinable items. Replace all open, unstructured discussion with clear process


What Components Does a Journey Map Include?
Must-haves
* Personas: the main characters that illustrate the needs, goals, thoughts, feelings, opinions, expectations, and pain points of the user;
* Timeline: a finite amount of time (e.g. 1 week or 1 year) or variable phases (e.g. awareness, decision-making, purchase, renewal);
* Emotion: peaks and valleys illustrating frustration, anxiety, happiness etc.;
* Touchpoints: customer actions and interactions with the organization. This is the WHAT the customer is doing; and
* Channels: where interaction takes place and the context of use (e.g. website, native app, call center, in-store). This is the WHERE they are interacting.

in our case:
1. personas: Gita from bangladesh going back to Dhaka international airport - for summer holiday; 
    1. Nick - business traveller - don’t check in - just fly with the 
    2. Personas - business, leasure, family, special needs
        1. Question - what is the persona we are interested in for this solution?
2. touch points - check about her luggage - phone app, kiosk in the airport, webportal 
3. stages: Plan, book, preflight, flight, arrival/post flight - https://www.behance.net/gallery/19543119/Customer-Journey-Map-Airline-Travel
4. on y axis - needs, pain points, emotional state, opportunities
5. before we jump into solutions - want to understand the customer journey map - 
6. Solution: In this case of luggage lost - the biggest emotional stress to the customer is during the transit and once landed (post fligt) -> need a solution to address that - this might be a part of other solution too but this will have to address this issue
    1. a kiosk to check the luggage status
    2. mobile app (might be part of the airline mobile app) - to check the status of the luggage
    3. rfid scanner to tell you where the luggage is -

how can you design a better kitchen?
pantry, sink, to oven top to shelves and table to try things out and most importantly space to invite friends to be at the kitchen to try food as i cook - engaging them in the experience is the best way to cook and enjoy the joy of food
- storing food in transparent and airtight containers - easy to see and safely stored
- based on the food on your refrigerator - show you the receipe - and the time you want to cook
- use smart rfid to keep the food at their desired temperature
- smart oven to only heat the utensils, auto off after no activity etc - safe and savings

Rapid prototyping 
- faster proof of concept and something end users can actually see and feel rather than a CAD design; quickly mocking up the future state of a system
- the design improves with each iterations with user feedback - 
- building confidence for both designer and customer
- saving cost and time - save some unneeded work if change is needed -very agile and open to change
- Prototype -> Review -> Refine -> Prototype
- prototype 20% of the functionality that will be used 80% of the time

Customer journey mapping:
- A customer journey map tells the story of the customer’s experience: from initial contact, through the process of engagement and into a long-term relationship.
- A customer journey map takes many forms but typically appears as some type of infographic. Whatever its form, the goal is the same: to teach organizations more about their customers.
- phases of journey - inquiry, comparision, purchase, installation, 
- If you are a designer, it will help you to understand the context of users
- It encourages people across the organization to consider the user’s feelings, questions and needs. This is especially important with digital products and services.
- discovery, engagement, conversion, reward
