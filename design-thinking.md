# Design thinking:

Design not an after thought but as part of the initial development process

DT steps:
1. Emphatize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

# Powerful tool to tackle the unknown
key elements:
1. learn from people  - understanding the context and the culture of the user
2. find patterns
3. design principles - what contraints do we have,
4. make tangible - work closely with customers; pros and cons of the solution
5. iterate relentlessly

# Help create strategies and identify new markets
Stages - 
1. invent a future (what customer might want but don’t have by emersing into their lives instead of just sending some surveys, observe and see what they are doing (behavior)
2. Test your ideas out - iterative prototyping, few quick experiments to see how customer responds. Adjust the product, pricing and positioning accordingly
3. Bring the new product or service to life - when you got a winner, identify an activity, capabilities and resources your company will need to actually produce, distribute, and operate it

Your customers expect more. And if you don’t give it to them they’re very likely to let you know about it, or worse, let all their friends know about it on a public platform. And we all know what happens when that occurs… you lose money.
But when you get it right, your audience is simply delighted. Your communication effortlessly takes away concerns, makes life easier, and depending on the topic could even save a few lives.

# User centric design:
1) Early Focus on User & Their Tasks
2) Evaluation & Measurement of Product Usage
3) Iterated Design
