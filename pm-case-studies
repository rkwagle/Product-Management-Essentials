Case studies - <to be edited>

framework here:
http://www.caseinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/caseinterviewframeworks.pdf
Segment revenues (by product, channel, customer type, region) (total revenues, revenues per unit) Segment costs (by fixed vs variable, costs within each segment of value chain) (total costs, cost per unit) 
Segment customers (by demographics, needs, purchasing patterns, price point, other) Segment competitors (by channel, region, product, customer segment) 


Formulae:
break even units = (fixed costs)/(sales per unit -variable cost per unit)
break even = fixed costs/contribution margin per unit
margin of safety = actual sales - breakeven point
return on sales = operating profit /net sales
NPV = present value of the future cash flows - present value of the initial investment costs
present value = C1/(1+r)^n
if marginal renenue < marginal cost -> the company is producing too much
if a company's marginal revenue is greater than its marginal cost, it indicates that the company is not producing enough units. When a company's marginal revenue equals its marginal cost, it's in the best position to maximize its profits


Business studies:
pricing - we can control; but will change the volume we sell and our profit margin
	change in price will also force competition to react and might compete with us in price
	promotional pricing (discount for sometime and return to original pricing) vs permanent pricing - to avoid the price war with competition
	promotion might also eat some of the future sales as well - coz people buy more during this time - “stocking up effect”
sales and cost of sales
competition - new entrant and pricing war from existing
business growth - new market and new products

elasticity of demand; if its -4, 
elasticity = % change in qty/% change in price 
if the price goes down by 10%, qty change will be 40% more

Break even calculation - a good practice when you don’t have all the data to make a decision and this will help you to solidify the solution

let’s say n is the stock up qty, then n/40 will be the stock up rate

Decision: even if the profit is high, we need to think of other impact factors like - stocking up effect
    - since we don’t have all the data, may be have a smaller promotional - very unlikely all the increase will be stock up
    - do some research and implement on only some regional small scales

sample use cases:
Things to consider:
customer demographics and desire
competition (no of competitors, framentation, brand name)
alignment with existing business strength - our expertise
barriers to entry, broader economic cycle, business cycle stage, 
time to market and opportunity cost
advertising effectiveness, our experience with launching similar product or service in the past
revenue sources, and the overall cost to support that 
what are the profit drivers?
barrier to entry - is it a regulated industry?	
what about the distribution channel?


ways to increase profitability:
- raise subscription fees, raise advertisement cost, reduce production costs, increase response rates, increase lifetime subscritpion value, increase advertisement volume

Things to consider:
- unpredictable revenue - dying revenue - how would investors react
- opportunity cost - can the lost money in the year 2 be used to attract new customers

==
Question #3: Now make the candidate calculate the market size, giving them the following data:
* Population of Moldova: 4 million
* Population Growth: 0%
* Average Life Expectancy: 75 years
* Age Distribution: assume a flat age distribution, i.e. same number of people at every age.
* Burial Customs: 75% of deaths are buried in coffins.
Possible Answer:
(4 million) x (1/75) * (75%) = 40,000 coffins purchased per year.

marginal revenue to understand and analyze - consumer demand, set product prices, plan production schedules

3 Cs - customer, competition, company
Evaluating from 3Cs - customers (is there demand), competetion (how fierce, new entrant, direct and indirect), company (what’s our expertise)
customers - age, economic bracket, how many times, how is the population demograhics changing
company - is there a waiting time, how are we peforming, occupancy etc
competitors - new entrant in the similar space, 

location - look for areas where they are getting hotspots, restaurant crowded region, shopping centers near, not near our exisiting restaurants

relative market share is the ratio of the company’s market share to that of its nearest competitor

1 dollar today is worth more than it will be tomorrow - because of interest and opportunity cost

calculate and evaluate and compare profit margin to compare 2 options if needed
If in doubt, a good recommendation would be to start in smaller scale and try out the market before investing big

Fragmented market - A marketplace where there is no one company that can exert enough influence to move the industry in a particular direction. The market consists of several small to medium-sized companies 	

Net present value, NPV, is a capital budgeting formula that calculates the difference between the present value of the cash inflows and outflows of a project or potential investment

NPV and perpetuity:
10% discount rate with 100K in cash flow = npv = 100K/0.1 = $1mil

Using the “rule of 72″, a 6% growth rate will double the investment every 72/6 = 12 years

Market sizing and guesstimate case interviews: how many people wear red in ny on monday?
1. step 1: clarify the question
    1. NY city or NY state?
    2. What does wear read really mean?
    3. if a person wearing red goes out more than once, shall we count that?
    4. just personal dress, uniform or anything red?
2. step 2: break down the problems
    1. population of ny city
    2. chances that people will wear red
        1. how many pieces of clothing people wear?
        2. the chances of one being red?
3. step 3: solve each piece
    1. ny population - 10 million
    2. 2.1 break it down further - on monday 5% people at home - 2 pieces
        1. going out once - for work - 70% - 5 pieces
        2. going out twice - 25% - 10 pieces
    3. 10% chance of each being red (total 8 or 10 colors)
4. step 4: consolidate into a final result
    1. solve for people in each group
        1. staying home = 10m*5%*2*10%
        2. going out once = 10m*70%*5*10%
        3. going out twice = 10m*25%*10*10%
